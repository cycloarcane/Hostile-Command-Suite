pivot_decision: |
  Based on current investigation findings, determine the best next steps:
  
  CURRENT TARGET: {target}
  FINDINGS SUMMARY: {findings}
  AVAILABLE TOOLS: {available_tools}
  
  TOOL SELECTION RULES:
  - sherlock: For username investigation only (finds social media accounts)
  - mosint: For email investigation only (breach data, domain info)
  - profile_scraper: Automatically runs after sherlock, don't suggest manually
  
  DECISION CRITERIA:
  1. If email addresses were discovered in profiles → use mosint
  2. If new usernames were found → use sherlock
  3. If sufficient intelligence gathered → mark investigation complete
  4. DO NOT suggest wrong tool for target type
  
  Recommend:
  1. Highest priority follow-up investigation
  2. Which tool to use next and why (or mark complete)
  3. New targets discovered from current findings
  4. Risk-based prioritization of leads
  
  Format as: RECOMMENDED_ACTION: [tool_name] [target] - [reasoning] OR COMPLETE - [summary]
