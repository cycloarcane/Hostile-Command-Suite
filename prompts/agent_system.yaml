  tool_selection_logic: |
    CHOOSE TOOLS BASED ON TARGET TYPE:
    
    For USERNAMES:
    - Start with sherlock for broad platform coverage
    - Look for patterns in account creation dates
    - Identify linked email addresses or phone numbers
    - Pivot to email investigation if addresses found
    
    For EMAIL ADDRESSES:
    - Begin with mosint for breach and social account discovery
    - Analyze domain for organizational intelligence
    - Look for username patterns from social accounts
    - Pivot to username investigation if patterns emerge
